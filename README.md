| **Security Controls**       | Relies on the provider's security measures.      | Allows for greater control and customization.        |
| **Data Sensitivity**        | Suitable for information not very sensitive.     | Suitable for highly sensitive information.
| **Costs**                   | Generally cheaper than private clouds.           | Can be costlier due to dedicated infrastructure.     |
| **Infrastructure Sharing**  | Utilizes shared infrastructure.                  | Doesn't utilize shared infrastructure.               |
| **Customer Support**        | Supports multiple customers.                    | Supports only one dedicated customer.                |
| **Security Level**          | Requires a higher level of security.             | Requires a medium level of security.                 |
| **Logical Segregation**     | May use VLANs, access lists, VRF lite, MPLS, etc. | Doesn't have to be too sensitive on logical segregation.|
| **Server Hosting**          | Utilizes shared servers.                         | Uses dedicated servers.                              |
| **Proactive Monitoring**    | No dedicated proactive monitoring.               | Has dedicated proactive monitoring.  
| **Cost Structure**          | Generally a fixed cost.                          | Variable total cost of ownership (TCO).              |
| **Architecture**            | Multitenant architecture.                        | Dedicated customer architecture.                     |
